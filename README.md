This project implements three different approaches to find the minimum risk path in a grid where movement is restricted to right and down directions only.

## Approaches
1. **Recursive Backtracking** - Brute force approach
2. **Memoization** - Top-down dynamic programming  
3. **Tabulation** - Bottom-up dynamic programming

## How to Run
1. Compile: `javac TreasureHunt.java TreasureHuntDriver.java`
2. Run: `java TreasureHuntDriver`
3. Test: `python3 test_treasure_hunt.py`

## Files
- `TreasureHunt.java` - Main implementation
- `TreasureHuntDriver.java` - Test driver
- `test_treasure_hunt.py` - Automated testing script
- `output.txt` - Expected output
